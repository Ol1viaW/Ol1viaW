## Projects

In this project, I developed code to optimize the racing calendar to minimize the carbon footprint and the total  
distance traveled between races given specified weather and location constraints.

I created a game featuring randomly generated worlds with interconnected rooms and hallways. Adapted Primâ€™s  
algorithm to traverse and connect rooms in a grid-based environment, ensuring all rooms are fully connected with  
minimal total hallway distance.
