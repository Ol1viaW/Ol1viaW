## Projects
<img align="left" width="220" height="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/Audit.png">**[Gilead Sciences: Identifying Anomalies in OPEX](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/Time-Burden-Water-Purification)**  

I worked with a team of interns to build an anomaly detection system using an Isolation Forest Machine Learning model, causal inference,
clustering algorithms, and time-series analysis. We applied the model to Gileadâ€™s general ledger to flag anomalous cost centers and transactions. We also presented key findings to Gileadâ€™s VP of audit. The code and analysis is redacted for confidentiality.

In collaboration with the Pickering Lab at UC Berkeley, I analyzed time burden of purifying water by compiling data from nationally representative surveys, harmonized variables using the DHS API, and ran statistical analyses in R. I also developed automated scripts to process text from 600+ research papers, enhancing efficiency in literature review and keyword identification.

<img align="left" width="220" height="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/Optimization.png"> **[Optimization of Formula 1 Calendar](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/Optimization-Formula-1-Calendar)**  

In this project, I developed python and AMPL code to optimize the racing calendar to minimize the carbon footprint and the total distance traveled between races given specified weather and location constraints.

I created a game featuring randomly generated worlds with interconnected rooms and hallways. I adapted Primâ€™s algorithm to traverse and connect rooms in a grid-based environment, ensuring all rooms are fully connected with minimal total hallway distance.

<img align="left" width="220" height="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/RSA.png">**[RSA Algorithm for Cryptography](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/RSA-Encryption-Decryption)**

I coded an RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt a message using a public and private key with the encryption based on the difficulty of factoring. The private key relies on calculations based on the Extended Euclidean algorithm.

<img align="left" width="220" height="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/Spam.png">**[Identifying Spam Emails](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/Identifying-Spam-Emails)**  

I built a binary classification to identify spam emails using feature engineering, logistic regression, and cross-validation.

<img align="left" width="220" height="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/Housing.png">**[Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/Housing-Price-Prediction)**  

I worked to create a fairer housing price prediction model utilizing data from Cook County, Illinois through data analysis and multi-dimensional data visualization.

##

<img align="left" width="220" height="120" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/Digits.png">**[Machine Learning Algorithm to Identify Handwriting Numbers](https://sites.google.com/view/computervisionwrittentotext/our-project?authuser=0)**

I worked with a team to develop and evaluate a logistic regression, a support vector, a random forest, a K-Means clustering, and a Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm that could identify handwritten digits.
