## Projects
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/telecom.jpg"> **[Optimization of Formula 1 Calendar](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/Optimization-Formula-1-Calendar)**  

In this project, I developed code to optimize the racing calendar to minimize the carbon footprint and the total distance traveled between races given specified weather and location constraints.

I created a game featuring randomly generated worlds with interconnected rooms and hallways. I adapted Primâ€™s algorithm to traverse and connect rooms in a grid-based environment, ensuring all rooms are fully connected with minimal total hallway distance.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/Spam.png">**[Identifying Spam Emails](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/Identifying-Spam-Emails)**  

I built a binary classification to identify spam emails using feature engineering, logistic regression, and cross-validation

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/Housing.png">**[Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/Housing-Price-Prediction)**  
I worked to create a fairer housing price prediction model utilizing data from Cook County, Illinois through data analysis and multi-dimensional data visualization

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/RSA.png">**[RSA Algorithm for Cryptography](https://github.com/Ol1viaW/RSA-Encryption-Decryption)**
I coded an RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt a message using a public and private key with the encryption based on the difficulty of factoring. The private key relies on calculations based on the Extended Euclidean algorithm. 

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ol1viaW/Ol1viaW/master/Images/Digits.png">**[Machine Learning Algorithm to Identify Handwriting Numbers](https://sites.google.com/view/computervisionwrittentotext/our-project?authuser=0)**
Worked with a team to develop and evaluate a logistic regression, a support vector, a random forest, a K-Means
clustering, and a Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm that could identify handwritten digits
